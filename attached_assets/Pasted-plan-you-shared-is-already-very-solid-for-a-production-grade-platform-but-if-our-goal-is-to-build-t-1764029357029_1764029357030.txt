plan you shared is already very solid for a production-grade platform, but if our goal is to build the biggest, viral, global prompt library with social features, there are a few critical additions and edits I’d recommend before starting:

1. Core Functionality – Additions

Advanced PQAS:

Include multi-model scoring (GPT, Gemini, Claude) for consistency across different LLMs.

Add automatic drift detection for older prompts (AAKE-style updates).

Viral Social Layer:

Karma engine that combines quality + engagement, not just popularity.

Reward system for remixes, shares, referrals, and high-quality UGC.

Prompt Recommendations / Personalization:

Suggest prompts based on user role, interests, and past activity.

Optional “Trending / New / Editor’s Choice” feeds.

Dynamic Tagging / Social Taxonomy:

Auto-generated social/AI tags based on content and engagement.

Hashtags for virality and content discovery (#Viral, #Tutorial, #UGC-Incentive).

Workflow Integration:

Link prompts into workflow chains (step-by-step prompt sequences).

Allow companies or teams to create shared workflow templates.

2. Database / Backend

Supabase is great, but for social graph features and multi-step relationships:

Consider Graph-like tables or Postgres extensions for SGE (Social Graph Engine).

Include lineage table for remix/fork tracking across users and prompts.

Usage logs should track API calls if enterprise clients use prompts.

3. UX / UI

Include visual Remix Editor: drag-and-drop or flowchart style for remixing prompts.

Responsive & mobile-first is good, but make a progressive web app (PWA) to increase engagement.

Implement skeleton loaders + live PQAS score updates to show users prompt quality in real time.

4. Monetization / Ads

Google Ads placeholders are fine, but consider:

Sponsored prompts with PQAS badges (non-intrusive).

Subscription tiers for advanced PQAS scoring or enterprise workflow tools.

Make sure ads don’t disrupt remixing or UGC creation—user-generated content must feel first-class.

5. Admin / Moderation

Include automated moderation for prompt content and comments.

PQAS thresholds for content publishing—admins can set min quality scores.

Ability to monitor viral loops (K-factor, top referrers).
