continue building this As 100M$ app UI/UX : A production-ready viral AI prompt library supporting text/image/video prompts across all domains with open-source PQAS, visual remix editor, gamification, and scalable architecture designed for massive growth 
I'll include the following features:

Multi-format authentication: email/password with secure bcrypt hashing, OAuth social login (Google, GitHub), granular role-based access control (guest, user, moderator, curator, org_admin, super_admin) with permission middleware on all protected routes and PostgreSQL row-level security policies
Comprehensive user profiles: avatar upload with image optimization and CDN-ready storage, rich-text bio with markdown support, portfolio grid showcasing user's top prompts sorted by PQAS and popularity, transparent karma score with interactive breakdown chart showing contribution sources, detailed contribution statistics, follower/following lists with mutual follow indicators, activity timeline showing all user actions (created/remixed/commented/upvoted) with timestamps
