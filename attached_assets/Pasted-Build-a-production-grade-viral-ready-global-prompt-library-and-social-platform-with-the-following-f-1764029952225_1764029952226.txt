Build a production-grade, viral-ready global prompt library and social platform with the following features:

1. User & Authentication: Email/password login, social login (Google, GitHub), role-based access (guest, user, moderator, curator, org_admin, super_admin).
2. User Profiles: Avatars, bios, portfolio showcase, activity timeline, karma score, contribution history.
3. Database: PostgreSQL with tables for users, prompts, prompt_versions, workflows, remixes (lineage tracking), comments, badges, usage_logs, follows, social_graph, with proper indexing for performance and scalability.
4. Prompt Management: Rich metadata including title, description, industry, tags, social hashtags, multi-AI model compatibility (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Midjourney, etc.), versioning with parent-child/fork lineage tracking, example inputs/outputs, visibility controls.
5. PQAS (Prompt Quality Assessment System): Multi-model scoring using OpenAI GPT, Claude, Gemini, evaluating quality, consistency, cost, latency, safety, with visual score ribbons and thresholds for production promotion.
6. Visual Remix Editor: Drag-and-drop interface showing prompt lineage graph, step-by-step workflow builder, fork/remix creation, auto PQAS re-evaluation on edits.
7. Social & Viral Engine: Follow/unfollow, activity feed, nested threaded comments with upvotes/downvotes, dynamic trending/new/personalized/editor’s choice feeds, referral tracking, and challenge-based campaigns.
8. Karma & Rewards: Reputation engine combining PQAS-weighted contributions, remix success rate, engagement, referrals; badge/achievement system for quality, virality, and milestones.
9. Search & Discovery: Full-text PostgreSQL search, AI-powered auto-tagging for industry/social hashtags, filters by model/industry/tags, sort by relevance/trending/newest/highest rated.
10. Enterprise & Workflows: Workflow templates for multi-step prompt sequences, execution tracking, adoption metrics, optional team/enterprise dashboards.
11. Monetization: Non-intrusive ad slots (sidebar, every 6th feed item, sponsored prompts), async-loaded with placeholders, labeled clearly as 'Sponsored', fully configurable via admin.
12. Admin Dashboard: Content moderation queue, PQAS thresholds for production, viral metrics monitoring (K-factor, top referrers, growth rate), ad slot management, user management.
13. PWA & Performance: Mobile-first responsive design, offline support, skeleton loaders, optimized bundle splitting, service worker, manifest.json, install prompts.
14. Analytics & Reporting: Usage stats for prompts, remix lineage analytics, global leaderboard, performance dashboards for users and admins.
15. Landing Page: Hero section, platform metrics (total prompts, users, industries), featured prompts carousel, trending tags, clear CTAs for signup and browse.

Build this with Supabase backend, React frontend (Tailwind CSS), and ensure the architecture is scalable for millions of users and prompts. Make it production-ready, fully free for users, and optimized for viral social growth, high-quality PQAS, and non-intrusive monetization. Include placeholders for Google Ads integration without compromising UX/UI.
